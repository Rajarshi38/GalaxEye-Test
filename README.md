# Intersect Console

Note - Made for GalaxEye Space Assessment

### Problem Description

A user comes to a console which has a base-map and an option to draw an AOI (Area of Interest). Upon selecting and area they will be presented with all the tiles (pre configured satellite imageâ€™s metadata) which are intersecting that AOI.

### Given Dataset

**Data details:** 100 tiles covering the whole state of Karnataka. A geojson file named `karnataka.geojson`

### Project Info

This is a geolocation category project by which we can draw a region,**which is called Area of our interest** on the map and based on a dataset which is given.

### Approach and Explanation

Approach I took is simple, no heavy design, no fancy things. Just a light themed fully responsive application with a white background, Heading and a Map container. Based on our AOI the interface will show us how many tiles have intersected.

### How to use

As we can see on the above picture right corner there are 5 icons, the first 3 are for drawing a region. The three icons were for Polygon, Circle and Rectangle. We can use any one of them and draw a region.

As we can see when we mark a region which is in blue color, the red tiles are appearing which are intersecting tiles. Clicking on the blue mark will show us `Area of Interest` and clicking on the red mark will show us `This is a intersecting tile`
