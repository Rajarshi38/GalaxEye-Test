# Intersect Console

Note - Made for GalaxEye Space Assessment

### Problem Description

A user comes to a console which has a base-map and an option to draw an AOI (Area of Interest). Upon selecting and area they will be presented with all the tiles (pre configured satellite imageâ€™s metadata) which are intersecting that AOI.

### Given Dataset

**Data details:** 100 tiles covering the whole state of Karnataka. A geojson file named `karnataka.geojson`

### Project Info

This is a geolocation category project by which we can draw a region,**which is called Area of our interest** on the map and based on a dataset which is given.

### Technologies used and How to build and start this project

The technologies which are used:

- Node - version 16
- React - version 18
- Vite - version 4
- react-leaflet - version 4.2.1

To start the project first clone it from github then, As the problem statement inclueded to add docker-compose setup, I have created the required `dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` for this. So to test the code, go to the terminal run `docker-compose build` or `docker compose build` and it will automatically install all the required packages for us. After that run `docker-compose up` or `docker compose up` to run the server at `port: 3000`.

If you want to access the files inside docker then run `docker exec -it leaflet-app sh`

### Approach and Explanation

Approach I took is simple, no heavy design, no fancy things. Just a light themed fully responsive application with a white background, Heading and a Map container. Based on our AOI the interface will show us how many tiles have intersected.

### How to use

As we can see on the above picture right corner there are 5 icons, the first 3 are for drawing a region. The three icons were for Polygon, Circle and Rectangle. We can use any one of them and draw a region.

As we can see when we mark a region which is in blue color, the red tiles are appearing which are intersecting tiles. Clicking on the blue mark will show us `Area of Interest` and clicking on the red mark will show us `This is a intersecting tile`

### Possible errors that could come

- One error could come related to vite and permission denied. We can delete our local node_modules if any then again run `docker-compose build` or `docker compose build` whatever and `docker compose up` or `docker-compose up`.
- Any other error could come if we have not setup docker properly to use it without sudo. Then you have to run the `docker compose` with `sudo`.
